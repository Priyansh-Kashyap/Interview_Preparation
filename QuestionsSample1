1. Introduce Yourself
 2. Statefile management
Ans. Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) stores the mapping between real infrastructure and
 configuration. Proper management involves storing it in remote backends like Azure Storage or S3
 to support collaboration, enable locking, and prevent data loss.
 3. Move block
Ans. The moved block is used in Terraform to tell Terraform that a resource has been moved or renamed.
 It avoids re-creating resources and ensures smooth renaming or refactoring without resource
 destruction.
 4. Difference between variable.tf, variables.tf, and tfvars files-
Ans. variable.tf / variables.tf: Define input variables with default values and types.- *.tfvars: Used to assign values to variables. You can have multiple tfvars files for different
 environments.
 5. Implicit and explicit dependency-
Ans. Implicit: Terraform figures out dependency based on references.- Explicit: Use depends_on to declare manual dependency when it's not obvious.
 6. Locking mechanism
Ans. State locking prevents simultaneous operations on the state file. Remote backends like Azure
 Storage or S3 with DynamoDB locking ensure only one person can make changes at a time,
 avoiding state corruption.
 7. Pattern module
Ans. Pattern modules are reusable Terraform modules that implement best practices. They improve
 consistency, reduce duplication, and follow the DRY principle.
 8. Type Constraints in Terraform
Ans. Define variable types like string, number, bool, list, map, etc., for strict input control. It prevents
 unexpected values and ensures predictable behavior.
 9. When will the state file be created?
Ans The state file is created after the first successful terraform apply. It captures the current state of
 resources after deployment.
 10. What is linting? - TFLint
Ans. Linting checks code for errors and best practices. TFLint analyzes Terraform code to catch issues
 early like unused variables, deprecated syntax, or wrong resource types.
 11. Git push and git commit- 
Ans. git commit: Saves changes to local repo with a message.- git push: Uploads committed changes to the remote repository like GitHub.
 12. Process for PR (Pull Request)
Ans. 1. Create a feature branch
 2. Push your code
 3. Open a PR
 4. Add reviewers
 5. Review and approve
 6. Merge PR
 7. CI/CD pipeline gets triggered.
 13. Deployment group and task group- 
Ans. Deployment group: A set of target machines for agent-based deployments.- Task group: Reusable collection of pipeline tasks bundled together.
 14. Service connection
 Ans. A secure way to connect Azure DevOps to external systems like Azure, GitHub, DockerHub, etc. It
 stores credentials safely and enables authentication for pipeline actions.
15. Security best practices for pipeline- 
Ans. Use service connections with least privilege- Store secrets in secure libraries- Enable approvals- Use private agents for sensitive builds- Scan code and containers- Implement RBAC and auditing
