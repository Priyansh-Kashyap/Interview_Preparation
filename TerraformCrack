Ques1: What is Terraform? Why we use it?
Ans- Terraform is an IAC tool which is infrastructure as Code which is used to creating and managing resources on cloud through an accessible APIs.
Why we are using it:- 
a) Multi Cloud Provisioning (can use on AWS, GCP, Azure)
b) State management: means you can track infrastructure and detect any changes
c) Automation in CI/CD pipeline: means we can automate our infrastructure through AzureDevops pipeline
d) Reusable Modules: means we can implement parent child module strategy to  create our resources and reuse it whenever needed

Ques2: What is Provider?
Ans: Provider is a plugin that enables Terraform to interact virtually with the cloud or other services through an accessible APIs

Ques3: Write a code of provider file!
Ans:   terraform{                 //This is the block where we define our global setting for terraform
        required_providers{           // This block tells the terraform which cloud provider it should use
        azurerm = {                   // It is just a name assigned to the provider
        source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
        version = "4.29.0"
  }
 }
}
provider "azurerm"{                   // This block tells the terraform that we want to interact with the cloud platform
     features{}
     subscription_id = "azure_id"
}

Ques4: What does "terraform init" command mean?
Ans: This command scans the .tf file in the configuration and the intializes the backend and provider plugins
      further it creates
a) .terraform folder:
b) .terraform.lock.hcl

Ques5: Can we run terraform init without .tf files?
Ans: No, we can't intialize terraform without .tf file if we do so then we get an error "Terraform initialize in an empty directory!"

Ques6: What happens when we run terraform init without provider but we have resource.tf?
Ans: Terraform will scan the resource.tf file and then intialize the backend and provider plugins and pulls latest version of provider from hashicorp

Ques7: What happens when we run "terraform plan" without provider?
Ans: Terraform will throws an error "Invalid provider configuration"

Ques8: Why we get an error "Inconsistent dependency lock file"?
Ans: We get this error when terraform found that configuartion provider version does not match with locked version in .terraform.lock.hcl
to solve this error run command
"terraform init -upgrade"

Ques9: What does "terraform plan" mean?
Ans: This command defines what resources will create, update or delete based on the existing configuration file

Ques10: What does "terraform apply" mean?
